# A journey through algorithms

## Introduction

This blog is a set of algorithms descriptions meant to build a baseline for understanding and solving complex problems.
Solving complex problems is not only an activity one can enjoy, it's also a proof one can accomplish things.
If life can be seen as a multiple branching probability paths, the way I approach life, is then by making sure I build a path that is a succession of optimally solved problems.
