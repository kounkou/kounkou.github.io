# A financial advisor for your investments


## Introduction

Let me make it straight and ask the big question now : is there any way to find the best investment strategy over the course of a certain number of months ?
That question might sound innocent and pristine at first glance, but give me a chance and keep reading,
it will be worth it.
I am in Vancouver region, and bank's compition is fierce here. With inflation going up and scaring us all, some banks
are really working hard and providing amazing interest rates for saving and retirement accounts that are so interesting that it's almost impossible to resist,... If you have no idea what I am talking right now, I guess you're probably very rich, or with a higher probability less than average and struggling hard with your finance.
Maybe you want to save, or maybe you just want to invest, and make some money out of your money and you just realized your
0.55% or that 1.5% savings account arenot good enough to keep up with the cost of living ?
In this article I am providing outputs from a project I am working on, to maximize your return on investment for specific banks located in Canada. But the code source can be adapted with minimum effort to any bank.
