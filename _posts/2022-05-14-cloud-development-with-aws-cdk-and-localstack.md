# Cloud development

## Introduction

In the last 2 weeks, I have been travelling between 3 different continents!
While getting access to internet was less of a challenge than what I had initially thought, I still didn't feel confident 
my activities on unsecure networks like Hotels and Caf√©'s wifi networks.
I have recently learnt about Cloud development, and still wanted to learn about Cloud development during my vactions, for this reason,
I dedicate this article to people willing like me, to work on Cloud develop off the internet.

## Packages Installation

For the sake of this article, I chose to only explore AWS solutions for Cloud development. For this reason,
I am using aws cdk and localstack. The following command will help you install the packages necessary for the rest of the article.

```bash
npm install -g aws-cdk-local aws-cdk
```
