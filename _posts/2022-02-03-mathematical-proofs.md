# Mathematical Proofs

## Introduction

In this Blog post, I am discussing my understanding of my 3 most powerful Mathematical Proof strategies.


## Induction

Mathematical induction is a prood technic, that demonstrates that a statement
holds for all natural numbers N (0, 1, 2, 3, ...)
To prove a statement by induction, there are 2 steps to follow :

1. Prove that the statement holds for the Base case.
2. Prove that the statement holds for the case k + 1.

Example :

In this example we want to prove that the sum of n integers is 


<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?\sum_{1}^{k}&space;n&space;=&space;n&space;*&space;(n&space;&plus;&space;1)&space;/&space;2" title="\sum_{1}^{k} n = n * (n + 1) / 2" />
