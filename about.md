I am an enthusiast Software Development Engineer with over 6 years experience developing heavy client based applications using C++ and Qt/QML at General Electric (at GE Healthcare) and 3 years combined of experience in Golang, Typescript with React and Java, developing scalable, and fault tolerant microservices Amazon (at AWS). I am passionate about programming languages, to help answer customer needs.

During my 3 years tenure at Amazon AWS, I was part of the EventBridge team responsible for developing, maintaining and operating features around our core functionality which is connecting applications through events. As a Software Engineer, my primary focus was on designing and implementing the front end and the backend functionalities to support Global endpoints and API destinations and operating those services on a daily basis.

One particular challenge we faced from the backend perspective, after the delivery of Global endpoints was a high number of high severity tickets due to a bug in the feature. To address this, I participated to re-architecturing our asynchronous workflow. As a result, I reduced the number of high severity ticket from 2 per day to roughly 1 per week.

Another particular challenge we faced from the fondend perspective during the development of API destinations was a very tight time constraints with regards to estimated time for developing the Front end in React JS for API destinattions. To address this, I took the lead and proposed to fully reuse components and help shorten the development time for the API destinations User interface. As a result, I could deliver API destinations on time.

Throughout the project I also had the opportunity to work with product manager, designers and front end or other backend developers to ensure seamless integration of the feature and the fastest adoption rate. These were key to our success in delivering a high quality product on time on one side and to improve quality on the other side.

Reflecting on this experience,  learned the importance of teamwork, adaptability, and problem solving in a fast paced and dynamic environment. It was a rewarding experience and I am proud of the contributions I made to the EventBridge team.
